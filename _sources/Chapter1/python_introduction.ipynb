    "It's employed for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. server-side web development, \n",
    "2. software development, \n",

    "3. Python has a database system connection feature. Files can also be read and changed by it.\n",

    "1. Python runs on a variety of platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "2. Python has a straightforward syntax that resembles that of English.\n",
    "3. Compared to other programming languages, Python's syntax enables programmers to construct applications with less lines of code.\n",
    "4. Since Python uses an interpreter system, code can be executed immediately after it is written. As a result, prototyping can proceed quickly.\n",
    "5. Python can be used in a functional, object-oriented, or procedural manner."

    "2. Python will be written in a text editor for this tutorial. Python can be written in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans, or Eclipse. These IDEs are especially helpful for organising huge collections of Python files."

    "1. Python was created with readability in mind and, thanks to mathematical influence, shares certain parallels with the English language.\n",
    "2. In contrast to other programming languages, which frequently employ semicolons or parentheses, Python uses new lines to complete a command.\n",
    "3. To describe scope, including the scope of loops, functions, and classes, Python uses indentation with whitespace. Curly brackets are frequently used in other computer languages for this reason."
