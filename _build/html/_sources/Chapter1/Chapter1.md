# Python Fundamentals

Python is a robust programming language that is simple to learn. Its object-oriented programming methodology is straightforward but efficient, and it includes good high-level data structures. Python is a fantastic language for scripting and quick application development in many domains on most platforms because to its clean syntax, dynamic typing, and nature of being an interpreted language.

The comprehensive standard library and the Python interpreter are freely distributable and are accessible on the Python website, https://www.python.org/, in source or binary form for all popular platforms. The same website also provides links to further documentation as well as releases of numerous free third-party Python modules, programmes, and tools.

It is simple to add new functions and data types to the Python interpreter that were developed in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is a good choice as an add-on language for flexible software.

The reader is given a casual introduction to the fundamental ideas and capabilities of the Python system and language in this lesson. For practical experience, it is helpful to have a Python interpreter on hand, although the lesson can also be read offline because each example is self-contained.

See The Python Standard Library for a description of common objects and modules. A more official definition of the language can be found in the Python Language Reference. Read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual to learn how to create extensions in C or C++.
